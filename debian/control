Description: User space TCP/IP pipe.
 A TCP/IP pipe is a user space programme that listens for TCP/IP
 connections on port on the local host and when a client connects makes a
 connection to a TCP port, possibly on another host. Once both connections
 are established data sent on one connection is relayed to the other, hence
 forming a bi-directional pipe.
 .
 Uses include enabling connections to specific ports on hosts behind a
 packet filter.
 .
 This code is intended primarily as an example of how many of the features
 of libvanessa_socket work.
